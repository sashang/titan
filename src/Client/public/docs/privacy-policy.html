<h2 id="welcome-to-tewtins-privacy-policy">Welcome to Tewtin&#39;s Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Hi there, we’re Tewtin&#39;s Pty Ltd (ABN 27 522 078 458) of 214/15 Pascoe
Street, Pascoe Vale, Victoria, Australia(&quot;Tewtin&quot;) and welcome to our privacy
policy. This policy sets out how we handle your personal information if
you’re an Tewtin user or visitor to our Site. When we say ‘we’, ‘us’ or
‘Tewtin’ it’s because that’s who we are and we own and run the Site. If we
say ‘policy’ we’re talking about this privacy policy. If we say ‘user terms’
we’re talking about the rules for using the Site. </p>
<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Part of Tewtin&#39;s business model is to offer a service where the user&#39;s data
is not resold for the purposes of data mining or advertising by 3rd party
companies. Typically free video conferencing software is free because you
allow the providers of such software access to your personal data, and data
gathered while using the software, which includes but is not limited to
text, voice and video. At Tewtin, we do not do this, because we believe that
a product used for education should not be collecting the data of students&#39;
for consumption by a 3rd party.</p>
<h2 id="the-type-of-personal-information-we-collect">The type of personal information we collect</h2>
<p>We collect certain personal information about visitors and users of our Site.
The most common types of information we collect include things like:
user-names, member names, email addresses, IP addresses, other contact
details, survey responses, blogs, photos, payment information such as payment
agent details, transactional details, tax information, support queries, forum
comments (if applicable), content you direct us to make available on our
Site (such as item descriptions), your actions on our Site (including any
selections or inputs into items) and web and email analytics data. We will
also collect personal information from job applications (such as, your CV,
the application form itself, cover letter and interview notes).</p>
<h2 id="how-we-collect-personal-information">How we collect personal information</h2>
<p>We collect personal information directly when you provide it to us,
automatically as you navigate through the Site, or through other people when
you use services associated with the Site. We collect your personal
information when you provide it to us when you complete membership
registration and buy or provide items or services on our Site, subscribe to
a newsletter, email list, submit feedback, enter a contest, fill out a
survey, or send us a communication.</p>
<h2 id="personal-information-we-collect-about-you-from-others">Personal information we collect about you from others</h2>
<p>Although we generally collect personal information directly from you, on
occasion, we also collect certain categories of personal information about
you from other sources. In particular: financial and/or transaction details
from payment providers located in the US, UK, and Australia in order to
process a transaction; third party service providers (like Google, Facebook)
who are located in the US or UK, which may provide information about you when
you link, connect, or login to your account with the third party provider and
they send us information such as your registration and profile from that
service. The information varies and is controlled by that service provider or
as authorized by you via your privacy settings at that service provider; and
other third party sources/and or partners from Australia, US or UK, whereby
we receive additional information about you (to the extent permitted by
applicable law), such as demographic data or fraud detection information, and
combine it with information we have about you. For example, fraud warnings
from service providers like identity verification service. We also receive
information about you and your activities on and off the Tewtin platform
through partnerships, or about your experiences and interactions from our
partner ad networks. We also receive information about you as a rights holder
from our third party authors. For example, information in the form of a model
release when your image is used in an item made available on our Site. How we

of your personal information.</p>

some processing that is based on our legitimate interests, such as profiling
that we perform for the purposes of direct marketing, and, where we have
asked for your consent to process your data, to withdraw this consent as more
fully described below.</p>
<p>These rights are limited in some situations – for example, we can demonstrate
that we have a legal requirement to process your personal information. In
some instances, this means that we may retain some data even if you withdraw
your consent.</p>
<p>Where we require your personal information to comply with legal or
contractual obligations, then provision of such data is mandatory: if such
data is not provided, then we will not be able to manage our contractual
relationship with you, or to meet obligations placed on us. In all other
cases, provision of requested personal information is optional.</p>
<p>If you have unresolved concerns you also have the right to complain to data
protection authorities. The relevant data protection authority will be the

(ii) of your place of work; or (iii) in which you consider the alleged
infringement has occurred.</p>
<p>Both personal information and personal data have the same meaning in the
context of this Privacy Policy.</p>
